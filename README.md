# BMI Calculator

This is a flutter project I created, with the aim of calculating your body mass index (BMI). Your BMI is a reliable indicator of body fatness and is used to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems. It is calculated by dividing your weight by your height squared (w/hÂ²).

You can make an entry for each day, recording your weight and height, and the app will automatically calculate your BMI for you. You can click on each entry to expand it and see additional information about the entry.  There is also a line chart that graphs your BMI over the past 7 days.

This is also my first flutter project where I have made it responsive, meaning it works well in portrait *and* landscape mode.
